# BookSearch
search google books api
## description 
this app uses http to make requests to google api to fetch data,
then represent it in list view.<br>
with its basic setting activity you can modify some settings to modify the results.
### wait.. it's not complete yet
yeah, i didn't take care to represent all data i got from the server -even i inisialized the full class and indeed i parsed 
all the json important data-
<b>but</b> only represent the title and thumbnail for the user because i wnated to test my
ability to download and represent image data to user with picasso,
#### what it really need
I will try modify the edit text and use more advanced search widget that gives user suggestions IN LATER TIME .
